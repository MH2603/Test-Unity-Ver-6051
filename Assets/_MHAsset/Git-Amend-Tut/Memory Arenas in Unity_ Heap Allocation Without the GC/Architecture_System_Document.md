### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Initialization Phase**: Arena pre-allocates contiguous memory buffer
2. **Allocation Phase**: Sequential pointer arithmetic distributes memory chunks
3. **Usage Phase**: Unsafe pointers access allocated memory regions
4. **Reset Phase**: Single operation resets all allocations
5. **Disposal Phase**: Unmanaged memory buffer is freed

### Memory Management Approach
- **Arena-based Allocation**: Single large allocation with linear sub-allocation
- **Zero Garbage Collection**: All memory operations occur in unmanaged space
- **Pointer-based Architecture**: Direct memory access through unsafe pointers
- **Bulk Deallocation**: Entire arena reset in constant time

## 6. Core System Architecture

### 6.1 ArenaAllocator (Core Memory Management)

**Purpose**: Provides the fundamental memory arena allocation infrastructure.

**Key Components**:
- `byte* buffer`: Base pointer to allocated memory region
- `int offset`: Current allocation position tracker  
- `int capacity`: Total arena size in bytes
- `Alloc<T>()`: Generic allocation method with type safety
- `Reset()`: Instant deallocation of entire arena
- `Dispose()`: Unmanaged memory cleanup

**Implementation Strategy**:
```csharp
// Allocation Pattern
T* ptr = (T*)(buffer + offset);
offset += UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<T>() * count;
return ptr;
```

### 6.2 CraftSimulator (Application Logic)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates practical arena allocation usage through crafting dependency analysis.

**Key Components**:
- `CraftNode` struct: Unsafe tree node structure for dependency graphs
- Recursive simulation algorithm with arena-allocated intermediate results
- Bottleneck analysis across ingredient requirements
- Complete dependency tree construction

**Allocation Patterns**:
- Tree node allocation: `arena.Alloc<CraftNode>()`
- Pointer array allocation: `arena.Alloc<byte>(sizeof(CraftNode*) * count)`
- Zero managed heap pressure during complex tree operations

### 6.3 Data Management (Inventory & Recipes)

**Purpose**: Provides the underlying data layer for crafting operations.

**Components**:
- `Inventory`: Dictionary-based item quantity management
- `RecipeBook`: Recipe lookup and storage system
- `ItemType`: Enumeration for type-safe item identification
- `Recipe`/`Ingredient`: Crafting rule definitions

**Integration Pattern**: Traditional managed objects providing stable reference data for arena-allocated computation trees.

## 7. Memory Management Architecture

### 7.1 Arena Allocation Strategy

**Linear Allocation Model**:
- Sequential memory distribution through pointer arithmetic
- No fragmentation or metadata overhead
- Predictable allocation performance characteristics
- Cache-friendly memory access patterns

**Memory Layout**:
```
Arena Buffer: [Used Memory][Free Space           ]
              ^           ^                      ^
            buffer    buffer+offset         buffer+capacity
```

### 7.2 Type Safety in Unsafe Context

**Generic Allocation with Constraints**:
```csharp
public T* Alloc<T>(int count = 1) where T : unmanaged
```

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time verification of type safety
- Automatic size calculation via `UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<T>()`
- Prevention of managed type allocation in unmanaged context

### 7.3 Memory Lifecycle Management

**Phases**:
1. **Construction**: `UnsafeUtility.Malloc()` with alignment requirements
2. **Allocation**: Pointer arithmetic advancement
3. **Reset**: Offset restoration to zero
4. **Disposal**: `UnsafeUtility.Free()` for cleanup

**Safety Guarantees**:
- Overflow detection before allocation
- Null pointer validation
- Proper alignment for performance
- Deterministic cleanup patterns

## 8. Performance Characteristics

## 9. Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### 9.1 Initialization Pattern
```csharp
// Size arena for expected maximum usage
int maxNodes = 100;
arena = new ArenaAllocator(UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<CraftNode>() * maxNodes);
```

### 9.2 Allocation Pattern
```csharp
// Allocate with type safety
CraftNode* node = arena.Alloc<CraftNode>();
// Use structured initialization
*node = new CraftNode { outputType = ItemType.IronSword, ... };
```

### 9.3 Cleanup Pattern
```csharp
// Reset for reuse (during gameplay)
arena.Reset();

// Final cleanup (on destroy)
arena.Dispose();
```
